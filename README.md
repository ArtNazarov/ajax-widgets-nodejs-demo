# ajax-widgets-nodejs-demo
Demonstrate how to create AJAX widgets in your nodejs projects

In this project we create two widgets which request information from server by their id which we place in data attribute of html div element. All our widgets have got one class "echo" for client side script. Client execute ajax requests for each element with class "echo"
Server will perform echo operation and return as a response requested id. Read files mindfully. You can easily modify it to return other information in your projects in ajax style.

Install required modules in project folder
```
npm install express
npm install http
npm install fs
```
